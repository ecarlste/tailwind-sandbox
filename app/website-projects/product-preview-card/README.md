## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I mostly learned about using the `leading` and `tracking` tailwindcss classes to set the CSS properties `line-height` and `letter-spacing`. I was able to get the text to be spot on by referencing the values in Figma and then using the matching tailwindcss values. For any that were not provided by default, I used custom pixel values to get the size right.

### Continued development

I'd like to switch the image section from being an adjusted background image to just being a Next.js `Image` type so that I can take full advantage of the image optimization that Next.js provides.
